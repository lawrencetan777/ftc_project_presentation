# This program returns steps a robot needs to take to visit n user-inputted points and back tot he start on a 10x10 grid
# When you run the code, it will prompt you for the starting point's coordinate as x,y (no spaces).
# Next, it will prompt you for the number of targets
# After that, it will prompt for the coordinates of each target
# Finally, it will print the results onto the terminal as a series of steps
# Each step is in the format (u, d) AT (x,y) distance moved D. u is the number of units moved, d is the direction it moved (U for up, D for down, L for left, and R for right). x and y are the coordinates of the point the robot is at after the step, and D is the total distance moved by the robot since the beginning of the program.
# After all the steps have been generated, the program will end.
