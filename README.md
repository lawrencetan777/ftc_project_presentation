<p> This program returns steps a robot needs to take to visit n user-inputted points and back tot he start on a 10x10 grid. <br>
 When you run the code, it will prompt you for the starting point's coordinate as x,y (no spaces). <br>
 Next, it will prompt you for the number of targets. <br>
 After that, it will prompt for the coordinates of each target. <br>
 Finally, it will print the results onto the terminal as a series of steps. <br>
 Each step is in the format (u, d) AT (x,y) distance moved D. u is the number of units moved, d is the direction it moved (U for up, D for down, L for <br> left, and R for right). x and y are the coordinates of the point the robot is at after the step, and D is the total distance moved by the robot <br> since the beginning of the program.<br>
 After all the steps have been generated, the program will end.</p>
